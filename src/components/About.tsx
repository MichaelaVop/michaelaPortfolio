            <p>
                Hi, I am <span>Misha</span>, an enthusiastic front-end web developer 
                with an extensive background in marketing and strength in strategic 
                thinking and workflow management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Have a passion for user experience and am proficient in embracing
                target groups' needs and behaviours. Learning and growing as
                a developer is important to me, and I am currently working
                on 3+ front-end projects for my diploma program. I am excellent
                at working in teams and have great self-management skills as
                I have been working as a solo-entrepreneur for the last few years.

                <h4>My developer journey so far</h4>
                <p>
                    Recently, I have finished an academic part of the Web Development 
                    diploma study program at Cornerstone College.
                    During my studies, I have learned several languages and got to know 
                    frameworks, libraries, and environments such as React, Node.js, Express.js, 
                    Next.js, SASS, Material-UI, Bootstrap etc. 
                    I am the most confident in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I also 
                    learned some Java and have used TypeScript for some of my projects. 
                    I find TypeScript very useful and immensely enjoy working with it. 
                </p>
        

                <div className='languagesContainer'>
                    <h5>Languages</h5>
                    <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript</p>
                    <h5>Frameworks, libraries and environments</h5>
                    <p>React, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, Sass, Material-UI, Bootstrap</p>
                </div>

          
                <h4>And a lot of other work experience</h4>
                <p>
                    Started my first full-time position when I was studying 
                    the Corporate Economics and Management masters program. 
                    Changed different fields and positions and ended up in marketing. 
                    I have always had a passion for user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an account manager, and especially a copywriter, 
                    I have learned how to embrace target groupsâ€™ needs 
                    and behaviours and engage them in required action. I also 
                    gained significant strength in communication with clients, 
                    strategic thinking, and workflow management, as I have been working 
                    as a solo entrepreneur for the last few years.
